	It's Monday morning, 7am. No one is quite prepared to start the week, especially not the kids. Sulkily, they walk to 
school. And though the teachers who are already inside and have been since the early hours don't show it as much,
many of them too are not quite ready to begin the week. But there is someone who is always prepared, always cheery
and always on top of it. Every weekday right as the first of the children start showing up to school, his eyes
light up, a soft humming noise is heard for a few seconds, followed by a booming "GOOOOD MORNING!" or a
"WONDERFUL DAY WE'RE HAVING!", or anything really, but never anything negative, and always something loud.
Robbie the crossing robot was always excited to do his job. And the kids loved seeing him! His purpose wasn't
just safety, but also to bring some liveliness and joy to anyone around him.
