	It's Monday morning, 7am. No one is quite prepared to start the week, especially not the kids. Sulkily, they walk to 
school. And though the teachers who are already inside and have been since the early hours don't show it as much,
many of them too are not quite ready to begin the week. But there is someone who is always prepared, always cheery
and always on top of it. Every weekday right as the first of the children start showing up to school, his eyes
light up, a soft humming noise is heard for a few seconds, followed by a booming "GOOOOD MORNING!" or a
"WONDERFUL DAY WE'RE HAVING!", or anything really, but never anything negative, and always something loud.
Robbie the crossing robot was always excited to do his job. And the kids loved seeing him! His purpose wasn't

"With great power comes great responsibility" these were the words that his master said before teaching him the ways of mixed martial arts. At this very moment,no words could express his excitement and so he nodded his head vigorously.His pupils dilated, his grin turned into a wide smile and this moment felt surreal. Ever since Jack was young he had dreamed of becoming a world-renown mixed martial artist. He watched every televised UFC fight and had posters of the league's best fighters on his bedroom wall. As he was watching those matches, he imagined being in the octagon, fighting for his pride, honor, the crowd chanting his name and he could feel the adrenaline martial arts brought to his life. To Jack, martial arts was not a sport to entertain the masses, it was his lifelong dream. He realized that this was the first step to attaining the life he fantasizes about.
